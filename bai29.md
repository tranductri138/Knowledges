Chắc chắn rồi! Bài tập này yêu cầu bạn chuyển các câu khẳng định ở thì hiện tại đơn sang hai dạng: **(a) câu phủ định (negative)** và **(b) câu nghi vấn (interrogative)**.

### Giải thích ý nghĩa và quy tắc

Để làm bài tập này, bạn cần nhớ quy tắc sử dụng trợ động từ `do` và `does`:

**1. Đối với câu phủ định (Negative):**

* Chủ ngữ là **I / You / We / They** và **danh từ số nhiều** (ví dụ: `the children`, `their dogs`):
  * Dùng **do not (don't) + động từ nguyên mẫu (không `s/es`)**.
  * Ví dụ: `They work` → `They **don't work**`.
* Chủ ngữ là **He / She / It** và **danh từ số ít** (ví dụ: `the park`, `Tom`):
  * Dùng **does not (doesn't) + động từ nguyên mẫu (không `s/es`)**.
  * Ví dụ: `He works` → `He **doesn't work**`.

**2. Đối với câu nghi vấn (Interrogative / Question):**

* Chủ ngữ là **I / You / We / They** và **danh từ số nhiều**:
  * Dùng **Do + chủ ngữ + động từ nguyên mẫu?**
  * Ví dụ: `They work` → `**Do** they **work**?`
* Chủ ngữ là **He / She / It** và **danh từ số ít**:
  * Dùng **Does + chủ ngữ + động từ nguyên mẫu?**
  * Ví dụ: `He works` → `**Does** he **work**?`

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
Trong bài này, ở câu 2 và 14, động từ `have` được dùng như một động từ thường (chỉ hành động "ăn" hoặc "có"). Vì vậy, bạn phải dùng trợ động từ `do/does` để đặt câu phủ định và nghi vấn, chứ không dùng `haven't/hasn't`.

* Ví dụ: `He has breakfast.` → `He **doesn't have** breakfast.` / `**Does** he **have** breakfast?`
