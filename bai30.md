Chắc chắn rồi! Bài tập này yêu cầu bạn chia các động từ trong ngoặc ở **thì hiện tại tiếp diễn (The present continuous tense)**. Dưới đây là phần giải thích quy tắc và đáp án chi tiết.

### Giải thích ý nghĩa và quy tắc

Thì hiện tại tiếp diễn được dùng để diễn tả:

1. **Hành động đang xảy ra ngay tại thời điểm nói.** (Ví dụ: `He is cleaning his shoes.`)
2. **Hành động đang diễn ra tạm thời trong một khoảng thời gian ở hiện tại.** (Ví dụ: `I'm reading "Crime and Punishment".`)
3. **Một kế hoạch hoặc sự sắp xếp chắc chắn trong tương lai gần.** (Ví dụ: `We are having breakfast at 8.00 tomorrow.`)
4. **Sự phàn nàn về một thói quen lặp đi lặp lại gây khó chịu (thường đi với `always`).** (Ví dụ: `She is always asking questions.`)

**Công thức chung:**

> **Chủ ngữ + am/is/are + Động từ-ing**

* **am** + V-ing (dùng với `I`)
* **is** + V-ing (dùng với `He, She, It`, danh từ số ít)
* **are** + V-ing (dùng với `You, We, They`, danh từ số nhiều)

**Quy tắc thêm `-ing`:**

* Hầu hết động từ: thêm `-ing` (ví dụ: `work` → `working`).
* Động từ tận cùng bằng `-e`: bỏ `-e` rồi thêm `-ing` (ví dụ: `come` → `coming`, `make` → `making`).
* Động từ có một âm tiết, tận cùng bằng **phụ âm - nguyên âm - phụ âm**: gấp đôi phụ âm cuối rồi thêm `-ing` (ví dụ: `swim` → `swimming`, `stop` → `stopping`, `cut` → `cutting`).
* Động từ tận cùng bằng `-ie`: đổi `-ie` thành `y` rồi thêm `-ing` (ví dụ: `lie` → `lying`).
